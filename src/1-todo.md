Hi Lucky
#   TODO LIST
##  Go through the list and take care of each of the following issues:

---

### Issue with Emails
* Rewrite the JS and find a solution to sending emails through FireFox and other browsers.
    * The culprit may be in the timing.

### Animations
* Change the timing on the banner header animations to be faster. They're too slow.

### Font Size
* The font is too small. Go in and change the font sizes to be fairly bigger; adjusting the section sizes as needed.

### Not Found
* Add an 'error 404: not found' page when the user tries to input an unsupported url.
